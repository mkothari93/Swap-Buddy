# Swap Buddy

## Description
Have extra stuff that you don’t use?  Want something someone else has? We built an app for you…
Then I am presented with a homepage with newly posted items, a  login and signup screen, once you are logged in you have the  ability to view items, message the postee and initiate a swap!
When I check my account, I can see posts created by me. In addition, I am also able to create a post and delete my posts.
