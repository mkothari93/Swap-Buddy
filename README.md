Have extra stuff that you don’t use?  Want an item that someone else has? We built an app for you…

Swap Buddy is an app that allows you to see items posted for trade. Upon opening the site, you are presented with a homepage with newly posted items and links to signup or login. Once you are logged in you have the ability to view your posts, delete your posts, and create new posts. 

For future development, user will be able to message the postee to initiate a swap.
